k05 -- Using a flask app to return a random occupation on a website
2022-10-07
time spent: 1.5 hrs

Disco:
* f strings to insert the result of python code into a string
* how to use modules (using github guide)
* flask must have one return value so use a string with HTML to parse multiple outputs
* br is a self closing tag
* flask automatically inserts the returned value into the body

QCC:
* __x__ is some special syntax in markdown
* how is css handled in flask?
* why can't multiple values be returned in one function in flask?
* how do we get flask to return a value in the <head></head> tag?

HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
1. Imports flask and occupation, where occupation.py represents the functions for lab 07
2. Creates a flask app
3. In the global scope, parses out the list of occupations from the dictionary of occupations to percentages 
and adds it to a string, string_of_occupations. The list of occupations never changes granted the occupations stays the same.
4. In the home route of flask, define the function random_occupation, which returns a string consisting of the TNPG + roster + results of generating a random occupation + list of occupations

from flask import Flask
import occupation #this is a copy of 06_py_csv

app = Flask(__name__) #create instance of class Flask

string_of_occupations = ""
#move outside of the function because the occupations are static
occupation_to_percent, total_percent = occupation.csv_to_dictionary() 
occupations = list(occupation_to_percent.keys()) #list of occupations
for oc in occupations:
    string_of_occupations += oc + "<br>" #<br> is line break


@app.route("/")       #assign fxn to route
def random_occupation():

    return_value = "TEAM FLASKERS - Harry Zhu, Kevin Wang, Daniel He <br><head><title>hello</title></head>" #TNPG + roster

    return_value += f"<h1> {occupation.get_random_occupation()} </h1><br>" #random dynamic occupation

    return return_value + string_of_occupations # list of strings at the end 
    

if __name__ == "__main__":  # true if this file NOT imported
    app.debug = True        # enable auto-reload upon code change
    app.run()
