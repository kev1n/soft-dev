k05 -- Using a flask app to return a random occupation on a website
2022-10-07
time spent: 1.5 hrs

Disco:
* f strings to insert the result of python code into a string
* how to use modules (using github guide)
* flask must have one return value so use a string with HTML to parse multiple outputs


QCC:
* __x__ is some special syntax in markdown
* how is css handled in flask?
* why can't multiple values be returned in one function in flask?


HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
1.
